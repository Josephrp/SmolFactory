## Details

Updated analysis to include EntryPoint component and clarify its interaction with Model Abstraction.

### EntryPoint
This component represents the primary execution flow of the `smollm3_finetune` application. It is responsible for initializing the application, parsing configuration, and orchestrating the high-level tasks such as initiating the model loading process and potentially the training or inference loops. It acts as the user-facing interface or the main script that kicks off the application's operations.


**Related Classes/Methods**:

- `smollm3_finetune.main` (1:1)


### Model Abstraction [[Expand]](./Model_Abstraction.md)
This component is responsible for encapsulating the complex logic of loading pre-trained models, defining their architectures, and managing various model variants such as quantization and LoRA adapters. It provides a unified and consistent interface for interacting with different model configurations, ensuring that the core training logic can operate seamlessly regardless of the underlying model specifics. This abstraction is crucial for maintaining modularity and flexibility within the machine learning training and fine-tuning framework.
