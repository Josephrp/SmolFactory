# Unified Repository Structure Implementation Summary

## Overview

This document summarizes the implementation of a unified repository structure where all models (main and quantized) are stored in a single Hugging Face repository with quantized models in subdirectories.

## Key Changes Made

### 1. Repository Structure

**Before:**
```
your-username/model-name/ (main model)
your-username/model-name-int8/ (int8 quantized)
your-username/model-name-int4/ (int4 quantized)
```

**After:**
```
your-username/model-name/
├── README.md (unified model card)
├── config.json
├── pytorch_model.bin
├── tokenizer.json
├── int8/ (quantized model for GPU)
│   ├── README.md
│   ├── config.json
│   └── pytorch_model.bin
└── int4/ (quantized model for CPU)
    ├── README.md
    ├── config.json
    └── pytorch_model.bin
```

## Technical Implementation Details

### Template Processing
```python
# Conditional sections
{{#if quantized_models}}
### Quantized Models
...
{{/if}}

# Variable replacement
model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained("{{repo_name}}/int8")
```

### Subdirectory Upload Logic
```python
# Determine subdirectory
if quant_type == "int8_weight_only":
    subdir = "int8"
elif quant_type == "int4_weight_only":
    subdir = "int4"

# Upload to subdirectory
repo_path = f"{subdir}/{relative_path}"
upload_file(
    path_or_fileobj=str(file_path),
    path_in_repo=repo_path,
    repo_id=self.repo_name,
    token=self.token
)
```

### Launch Script Integration
```bash
# Create quantized models in same repository
python scripts/model_tonic/quantize_model.py /output-checkpoint "$REPO_NAME" \
    --quant-type "$QUANT_TYPE" \
    --device "$DEVICE" \
    --token "$HF_TOKEN"
```

## Benefits of the New Structure

- Single repository for all model versions
- Easier to track and manage
- Reduced repository clutter
- Unified documentation

### 2. Better User Experience
- Clear loading paths for all versions
- Comprehensive model card with all information
- Consistent URL structure
- Simplified deployment

### 3. Enhanced Documentation
- Single source of truth for model information
- Conditional sections for different versions
- Comprehensive usage examples
- Better discoverability

### 4. Improved Workflow
- Streamlined quantization process
- Reduced configuration complexity
- Better integration with existing pipeline
- Enhanced monitoring and tracking

## Usage Examples

### Loading Models
```python
# Main model
model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained("your-username/model-name")

# int8 quantized (GPU)
model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained("your-username/model-name/int8")

# int4 quantized (CPU)
model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained("your-username/model-name/int4")
```

### Pipeline Usage
```bash
# Run full pipeline with quantization
./launch.sh
# Choose quantization options when prompted
# All models will be in the same repository
```

### Standalone Quantization
```bash
# Quantize existing model
python scripts/model_tonic/quantize_standalone.py \
    /path/to/model your-username/model-name \
    --quant-type int8_weight_only
```
